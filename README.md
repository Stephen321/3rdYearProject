Place the following folders on the C: drive:
-zlib
-Box2D

Download FMOD Ex Programmerâ€™s API from [here](http://www.fmod.org/download-previous-products/) (you will have to register) or get the " " folder from the libraries folder on Google Drive mentioned about.
Open up enviroment variables and add a new variable with a name of "FMOD_SDK".
The value of these should be set to the api folder that is in the downloaded fmod folder directory.
If you downloaded from fmod.org then it will default to "C:\Program Files (x86)\FMOD SoundSystem\FMOD Programmers API Windows". And we set it to the "api" folder:

If you download instead from Google Drive then place it anywhere you want and put the directory to the api folder into the variable.
